## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "GEMINI_API_KEY not set"
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-key'
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY  # Verify it's set
```

### "Module not found"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Free tier: 15 requests/min, 1,500/day
- Wait 1 minute between analyses
- Or use rule-based system (no limits)

### Want faster results?
```bash
export MAX_ITERATIONS=1  # Reduce iterations
export LLM_PROVIDER='mock'  # Use mock (instant)
```
