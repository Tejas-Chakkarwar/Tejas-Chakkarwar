## ✅ What Was Cleaned Up

**Deleted (4 files):**
- ❌ `names.txt` - Empty placeholder
- ❌ `agentic_report_mobile_app.json` - Sample output
- ❌ `feasibility_report_mobile_app.json` - Sample output
- ❌ `feasibility_report_ai_healthcare.json` - Sample output

**Why deleted?**
- Reports are regenerated each run
- `names.txt` was unused

**Can regenerate reports anytime by running:**
```bash
python run_agentic_system.py research_feasibility_agent/examples/mobile_app.txt
```
