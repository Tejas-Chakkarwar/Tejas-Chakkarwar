# Truly Agentic Research Feasibility System

## Why This is TRULY Agentic (Not Just an API Wrapper)

### ❌ What This is NOT:
```python
# NOT agentic - just an API wrapper
def analyze(project):
    return llm.call(f"analyze this: {project}")
```

### ✅ What This IS:

**A multi-agent system where agents:**

1. **Make Autonomous Decisions**
   - Orchestrator decides analysis strategy
   - Research agent decides what information to search for
   - Validator agent decides if refinement is needed
   - Each agent decides which tools to use

2. **Coordinate with Each Other**
   - Orchestrator spawns and coordinates specialized agents
   - Agents communicate via structured messages
   - Parallel execution of multiple agents
   - Results synthesized across agents

3. **Use Tools Strategically**
   - Agents choose between LLM reasoning vs web search
   - Select appropriate tools based on task
   - Not hardcoded - decided by agent

4. **Iterate Until Confident**
   - Agents assess their own confidence
   - Orchestrator decides if refinement needed
   - Multiple iterations until threshold met
   - Adaptive workflow based on findings

5. **Validate and Reflect**
   - Validator agent checks consistency
   - Agents reflect on work quality
   - Self-assessment and improvement
   - Conflict detection and resolution

## Key Agentic Behaviors

### 1. Autonomous Decision-Making

**Example: Orchestrator Decides Strategy**
```python
# AGENT DECIDES: What's the analysis strategy?
strategy = await self._decide_strategy(request)

# Agent reasons with LLM:
# - Does this need external research?
# - What queries should research agent investigate?
# - Which dimensions need focus?
# - How long will this take?
```

**Example: Research Agent Decides What to Search**
```python
# AGENT DECIDES: What information is missing?
strategy = self._decide_search_strategy(query, info_type, context)

# Agent determines:
# - Broad vs specific search?
# - What aspects to focus on?
# - What sources are most credible?
# - What related queries help?
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination

**Orchestrator spawns agents in parallel:**
```python
# ORCHESTRATOR COORDINATES multiple agents
tasks = [
    tech_agent.analyze(request),
    cost_agent.analyze(request),
    ethical_agent.analyze(request),
    market_agent.analyze(request)
]
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

**Agents communicate via messages:**
```python
# Agents send structured messages
ResearchRequest → Research Agent → ResearchFindings
AnalysisRequest → Analysis Agents → DimensionAnalysis
ValidationRequest → Validator → ValidationResult
```

### 3. Tool Selection

**Agents choose which tools to use:**
```python
def select_tool(self, task: str) -> str:
    """Agent decides: LLM or web search?"""
    reasoning = self.tools['llm'].reason(f"Which tool for: {task}?")

    if 'web_search' in reasoning:
        return 'web_search'  # Agent chose web search
    else:
        return 'llm'  # Agent chose LLM reasoning
```

### 4. Iterative Refinement

**Orchestrator decides if refinement needed:**
```python
# AGENT EVALUATES confidence
validation = await self._validate_analyses(analyses)

# AGENT DECIDES to refine if needed
if validation['confidence'] < self.confidence_threshold:
    analyses = await self._refine_analyses(analyses)
```

**Iteration flow:**
```
Analyze → Validate → Low confidence? → Refine → Validate → Done
                         │
                         └─────── (max iterations)
```

### 5. Self-Reflection

**Agents reflect on their own work:**
```python
def reflect_on_work(self, work_done: str) -> Dict:
    """Agent evaluates its own work"""
    prompt = f"""
    You just completed: {work_done}

    Rate quality (0-100)
    What was done well?
    What could improve?
    Should this be refined?
    """
    return self.llm.reason(prompt)
```

### 6. LLM-Powered Reasoning (Not Keywords!)

**Technology Agent reasons about feasibility:**
```python
# NOT keyword matching - actual reasoning!
tech_assessment = await self._assess_technology_maturity(project)

# Agent reasons:
# - What technologies are required?
# - How mature are they really?
# - Are there proven implementations?
# - How available are developers?
# - What could go wrong?
```

**Example LLM prompt:**
```
Analyze the technology maturity for this project:
[project description]

Assess:
1. What technologies are required?
2. How mature is each technology?
3. Current state in the real world?
4. Proven implementations and case studies?
5. Developer skills availability?
6. Ecosystem maturity?

Provide detailed, reasoned assessment.
```

## Comparison: Keyword Matching vs Agentic Reasoning

### Old System (Keyword Matching):
```python
# Just counting keywords
if "quantum" in text:
    risk_score += 50

if "machine learning" in text:
    score += 20
```

### New System (Agentic Reasoning):
```python
# Agent actually THINKS about it
assessment = llm.reason("""
Analyze this project's technology:
[project description]

Consider:
- Real-world maturity of technologies
- Integration complexity
- Available expertise
- Ecosystem support
- Actual risks

Provide nuanced, contextual analysis.
""")
```

## Agent Capabilities

### Base Agent (All Agents Inherit):
- `decide()` - Make decisions based on situation
- `select_tool()` - Choose which tool to use
- `assess_situation()` - Evaluate current state
- `reflect_on_work()` - Self-evaluate quality
- `identify_information_gaps()` - Find missing info

### Research Agent:
- Decides what to research
- Chooses search strategies
- Evaluates result relevance
- Synthesizes findings
- Assesses own confidence

### Technology Agent:
- Reasons about tech maturity (not keywords!)
- Assesses implementation complexity
- Identifies technical risks
- Estimates realistic timelines
- Synthesizes multi-step analysis

### Orchestrator Agent:
- Decides overall strategy
- Coordinates multiple agents
- Validates consistency
- Determines if refinement needed
- Synthesizes final decision

## Usage

### Basic Usage (Mock LLM):
```bash
python run_agentic_system.py research_feasibility_agent/examples/mobile_app.txt
```

### With Real LLM (Google Gemini - FREE TIER! ⭐ Recommended):
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
export LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
python run_agentic_system.py research_feasibility_agent/examples/ai_healthcare.txt
```
**Get your free Gemini API key:** https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
**See:** [GEMINI_SETUP.md](GEMINI_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions

### With Real LLM (OpenAI):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
export LLM_PROVIDER=openai
python run_agentic_system.py research_feasibility_agent/examples/mobile_app.txt
```

### With Real LLM (Anthropic Claude):
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
export LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
python run_agentic_system.py research_feasibility_agent/examples/quantum_computing.txt
```

### Configuration:
```bash
# Set confidence threshold (default: 0.75)
export CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.80

# Set max iterations (default: 3)
export MAX_ITERATIONS=5

# Enable verbose agent reasoning
export VERBOSE_AGENT_REASONING=true
```

## What Happens When You Run It

```
1. ORCHESTRATOR THINKS: "What's the best strategy for analyzing this?"
   → Decides if research needed
   → Plans which agents to coordinate

2. RESEARCH AGENT ACTS: "Let me gather external information"
   → Decides what queries to search
   → Evaluates result relevance
   → Synthesizes findings

3. ORCHESTRATOR COORDINATES: "Launch parallel analysis"
   → Spawns 4 specialized agents simultaneously
   → Each agent reasons independently
   → Results collected

4. VALIDATOR CHECKS: "Are these analyses consistent?"
   → Detects conflicts
   → Calculates confidence
   → Decides if refinement needed

5. ORCHESTRATOR ITERATES: "Confidence low, let's refine"
   → Decides which analyses to improve
   → Coordinates refinement
   → Re-validates

6. ORCHESTRATOR SYNTHESIZES: "Here's my final decision"
   → Weighs all dimensions
   → Reasons about overall feasibility
   → Generates actionable recommendations
```
