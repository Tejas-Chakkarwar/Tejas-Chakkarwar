# Research Feasibility Agent - Fetch.AI uAgents

A truly agentic system for autonomously evaluating research project feasibility across multiple dimensions.

## Overview

This Research Feasibility Agent is built using Fetch.AI's uAgents framework and provides comprehensive, autonomous analysis of research projects. Simply provide a project description file, and the agent will analyze it across **four critical dimensions**:

1. **Technology Feasibility** - Assesses technical maturity, complexity, and implementation risks
2. **Cost Analysis** - Evaluates budget requirements, ROI potential, and funding sources
3. **Ethical Implications** - Analyzes ethical concerns, privacy, bias, and social impact
4. **Market Viability** - Examines market timing, competition, and commercial potential

The agent autonomously synthesizes findings from all four dimensions and generates intelligent recommendations about whether to proceed with the project.

## What Makes This "Truly Agentic"?

This agent demonstrates true agentic behavior through:

- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Makes intelligent go/no-go recommendations without human intervention
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Coordinates multiple specialized analyzer modules independently
- **Adaptive Scoring**: Uses weighted scoring that considers interdependencies between dimensions
- **Contextual Recommendations**: Generates specific, actionable next steps based on findings
- **Risk Assessment**: Autonomously identifies critical risks and key opportunities
- **Comprehensive Reasoning**: Synthesizes complex information across domains to reach conclusions

### Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository**

```bash
cd Tejas-Chakkarwar
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- `uagents` - Fetch.AI agent framework
- `pydantic` - Data validation
- `aiofiles` - Async file operations

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Create a project description file**

Create a text file describing your research project. Include details about:
- Project overview and goals
- Technical approach
- Target users/market
- Budget estimates
- Timeline
- Challenges and risks

See the `research_feasibility_agent/examples/` directory for sample project files.

2. **Run the analysis**

```bash
python test_agent.py path/to/your/project_description.txt
```

3. **Review the results**

The agent will:
- Analyze your project across all four dimensions
- Display a comprehensive feasibility report in the terminal
- Save a detailed JSON report: `feasibility_report_<project_name>.json`

### Example

```bash
python test_agent.py research_feasibility_agent/examples/ai_healthcare.txt
```

This will analyze the AI healthcare project example and generate a report.

## Understanding the Results

### Overall Feasibility Scores

- **80-100: Highly Feasible** - Strong project, recommend proceeding with confidence
- **65-79: Feasible** - Good project, proceed with attention to identified risks
- **50-64: Moderately Feasible** - Significant challenges, requires modifications
- **35-49: Challenging** - High risk, reconsider approach
- **0-34: Not Feasible** - Critical barriers, not recommended in current form

### Dimension Scores

Each dimension (Technology, Cost, Ethics, Market) is scored 0-100:
- **80-100**: Excellent, minimal concerns
- **60-79**: Good, manageable challenges
- **40-59**: Concerning, significant issues
- **20-39**: Poor, major barriers
- **0-19**: Critical, fundamental problems

### Weighted Scoring

The overall score uses weighted contributions:
- **Technology**: 30% - Technical feasibility is critical
- **Market**: 30% - Market opportunity drives success
- **Cost**: 20% - Financial viability matters
- **Ethics**: 20% - Ethical considerations are essential

## Advanced Usage

### Using the Fetch.AI Agent (Production)

The main agent (`research_feasibility_agent/agent.py`) is a full Fetch.AI uAgent that can:
- Run as a service
- Receive messages from other agents
- Process requests asynchronously
- Be part of a multi-agent system

To run the agent:

```python
from research_feasibility_agent.agent import agent

# The agent will start and listen for ProjectSubmission messages
agent.run()
```

### Integrating with Other Agents

```python
from uagents import Context, Model
from research_feasibility_agent.agent import ProjectSubmission

# From another agent, send a project for analysis:
await ctx.send(
    RESEARCH_AGENT_ADDRESS,
    ProjectSubmission(
        project_file_path="path/to/project.txt",
        requester_address=ctx.agent.address
    )
)
```

### Customizing Analysis Modules

Each analyzer module can be used independently:

```python
from research_feasibility_agent.modules import (
    TechnologyAnalyzer,
    CostAnalyzer,
    EthicalAnalyzer,
    MarketAnalyzer
)

# Use individual analyzers
tech_analyzer = TechnologyAnalyzer()
result = tech_analyzer.analyze("Your project description here...")

print(f"Technology Score: {result.feasibility_score}/100")
print(f"Maturity Level: {result.maturity_level}")
print(f"Complexity: {result.implementation_complexity}")
```

## How It Works

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Input Processing**: Agent reads project description from file
2. **Parallel Analysis**: Four specialized modules analyze independently:
   - Technology Analyzer examines technical aspects
   - Cost Analyzer evaluates financial requirements
   - Ethical Analyzer assesses ethical implications
   - Market Analyzer determines commercial viability
3. **Score Synthesis**: Weighted scoring combines individual dimension scores
4. **Intelligent Decision**: Agent determines overall feasibility
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Autonomous decision on proceed/modify/stop
6. **Report Creation**: Comprehensive report with actionable insights

### Decision-Making Logic

The agent uses sophisticated heuristics for each dimension:

**Technology**: Pattern matching against tech maturity databases, complexity indicators, development time estimation

**Cost**: Budget categorization based on scale indicators, resource requirements, team size

**Ethics**: Risk assessment based on domain sensitivity, privacy implications, bias potential

**Market**: Timing analysis against market maturity cycles, competition assessment, trend identification

## Creating Your Own Project Files

Your project description should include:

1. **Project Overview**: What are you building and why?
2. **Technical Approach**: Key technologies, architecture, methodology
3. **Market/Users**: Who will use it? What problem does it solve?
4. **Resources**: Team, budget, timeline estimates
5. **Challenges**: Known risks, obstacles, uncertainties

The more detailed your description, the more accurate the analysis.

**Template:**

```
[Project Title]

Project Overview:
[Describe what you're building, the problem it solves, and your approach]

Technical Approach:
[Technologies, architecture, key technical components]

Market Opportunity:
[Target users, market size, competitive landscape]

Team Requirements:
[Team size, key roles, expertise needed]

Timeline:
[Estimated development phases and timeline]

Budget:
[Estimated costs and funding needs]

Challenges:
[Known risks, uncertainties, obstacles]
```

## Limitations

- **Pattern-Based Analysis**: Uses keyword matching and heuristics, not true AI reasoning
- **Domain Knowledge**: Best for tech/research projects; may be less accurate for other domains
- **Static Data**: Uses built-in knowledge; doesn't fetch real-time market data
- **Qualitative Input**: Analysis quality depends on project description quality
- **English Only**: Currently only supports English descriptions

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) for deeper semantic understanding
- Real-time market data integration via APIs
- Multi-language support
- Interactive Q&A for clarification
- Historical project database for comparative analysis
- Collaboration with domain expert agents
- Visual report generation (charts, graphs)
- Integration with project management tools
